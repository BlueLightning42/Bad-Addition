# Bad-Addition
> I heard a friend in comp sci was giving a assignment to make the worst program to add 3 numbers. 
> It had this whole lesson to teach people to use good programming practices and stuff but honestly...
> it sounded kind of fun and I'm bored right now...and kinda wish I had fun assignments like that.

##### If anyone finds this feel free to implement your own version in whatever language you like.
*It can be as obsfucated or as obtusly written as possible-*
for example:
* Incrememnting something up to each of the values 
* Just having really dumb variable names with useless functions
* or using a weird reverse logic.

___

Actually the assignment had a second part that actually taught the lesson where all the students switched thire code with other peoples and had to then modify the other persons awful addition program...so I'm actually curious about if I'll get anyone to add to this cause it might be fun to try and do that. (no one ever finds this and I stay alone programming horribly in the darkness)

___

Anyways if anyone ever finds this feel free to try and modify any existing programs (without just rewriteing them) to instead of add- subtract the second two numbers from the first.
